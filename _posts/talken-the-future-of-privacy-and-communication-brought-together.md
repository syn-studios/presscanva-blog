I am the developer of Talken, a decentralised chat app built using java. It uses decentralised storage systems and thus facilitates us to send files over 5TB in size. It's decentralised server systems facilitate us to send messages even if the server is down, hence it completely bypasses sending the messages to the server and sends them directly to the receiver. It is also the first mainstream app that uses decentralised authentication of login out of the box, means here also - no servers involved in checking your login info, but this doesn't mean that your info is in insecure hands, it is also the most secure way of storing any kind of information that we are using in Talken, meaning that no hacker can crack this authentication without sheer brute-force or ultimate luck, where brute force also has to be used continuously for 5,000+ years and still nothing would be in their hands. This is because we don't store data in their raw form but in their hashed form mixed with hashes and a lot of salt and noise in between, and also we use multiple hashing algorithms stacked on each other for ultimate security guaranteed.

I am launching Talken soon, probably by the late August because the designing of Talken is still left to be done, and it will be done by my friends and me all involved deeply.

I can assure you that Talken will keep your data secure at all costs until the hacker has the complete access of your phone because then he can simply just open Talken for the data, and doesn't need to go through all the trouble, but outside Talken your data is all secure.
